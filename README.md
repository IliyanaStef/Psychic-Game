# Psychic-Game

The computer randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the computer chose. The player has 11 tries to guess the right letter:

When the player wins, the Wins counter increases and starts the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the Losses counter increases and restarts the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
